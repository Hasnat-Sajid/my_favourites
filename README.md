## My 5 Most Favourite Fast Foods

1. **Salami, Cheese and Kebab Pizza** - I love the gooey cheese and variety of toppings.
2. **Burgers** - Juicy patties, melted cheese, and crispy bacon? Yes, please!
3. **Tacos** - Crunchy shells, spicy meat, and fresh toppings make for a perfect combination.
4. **Fried Chicken** - Whether it's crispy wings or juicy thighs, I can never resist some good fried chicken.
5. **French Fries** - Crispy, salty, and the perfect side dish to any fast food meal.

> Note: These are in no particular order, as I love them all equally!
